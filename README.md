I’m a **Tech Lead Manager** at DiDi Autonomous Driving, where I lead the Tracking and Localization team. 


My expertise spans **multi-modal perception, SLAM, and world modeling**—I’m passionate about landing cutting-edge research into robust, scalable foundations for self-driving vehicles.


I hold a **Ph.D.** from the French National Institute of Geographic and Forestry Information (IGN), following my **M.S.** and **B.S.** degrees from Wuhan University.


I’m always open to technical collaborations to push the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.
